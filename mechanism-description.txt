To detect dead replicas we used a try, except for PUT and DELETE view operations to see if the replicas respond back or not.

Causal consistency:
We implemented the causal consistency list like the pdf described. Each replica that receives a request from client will check its' 
consistency list, which we called our "versionList" for the operation. If all the meta data is there, we execute the operation 
and broadcast to the other replicas. If not we wait until the dependent operation arrives.
