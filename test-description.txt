To test if our system works:

1. make 3 instances, all in the same view, with different socket ip's
2. send a PUT to one machine (all should get it)
3. stop 1 container, and send PUT to one of the two running replicas
    The replica receiving the PUT should forward it to both other replicas in VIEW
    Both running replicas have 2 PUTs, and should recognize that one Replica is down
4. after a timeout the Running replicas delete the downed ip from the VIEW
5. client sends a "GET_VIEW" , should only have 2 socket addresses
6. Next add another replica to VIEW
7. Added replica will update the VIEW of all ip's in its (correctly)updated VIEW,
    and ask for the current key-value-store
8. Client sends a GET_ALL to added replica, it should have both previous PUTs
